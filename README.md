Totoro Linux is an arch based distribution designed to be simple as possible and also easy to install.

# Thank you!

Totoro Linux has been a really fun project, but I feel it is time to wind it down to work on more ambitious projects. Truth is, Totoro Linux has outgrown it's base and I don't feel I can confidently continue to work on it, at least not alone. You are welcome to fork the project and continue my work, but it is time to wind down development. This is not a quitting note, I will continue to maintain Totoro if it ever breaks and needs fixing, but in terms of new features, there may not be many. This will not be my last distro project, as I plan to build a more independent distribution of GNU/Linux (with my own package manager etc.), however it feels innapropriate to restart this project completely, instead I feel it more appropriate to leave Totoro behind to work on somethiing more ambitious. Thank you.
